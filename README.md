# Differential_Drive_Obstacle_Avoidance_And_Pose_Reaching_Robot
This project implements a differential-drive robot controlled by Arduino that dynamically navigates to a desired pose while avoiding obstacles in its environment. The system integrates real-world robotic control with simulation for enhanced development and testing.
